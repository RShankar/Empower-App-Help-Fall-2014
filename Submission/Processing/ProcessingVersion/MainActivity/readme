1, Import google-play-services as a (dummy) project and select isLibrary (Project-->Props-->Android)
2. For the other App where you will use: generate the API key and place at the top before the activity
tags, not at the end.
3. Buildpath --> Add libraries --> add Google play services. For the MainActivity App, you will have
to add V4 dependency as well. 
4. Rearrange the order for export so src and bin come first. Then select all the other 4/5 items (Google
APIs, Andr Priv Libr, Andr Dep, goole play svcs, v4). 
5. Also choose Google API (4.3) not Android 4.3
6. For some reason, it still says that it cannot locate the google-play-svcs, but launched the App anyway,
for the MainActivity. 
7. For the MainActivity, I had to change the MainActivity to MainMapActivity -- since there was somewhere 
an activity entitled 'MainActivity.'
8. Note that you cannot choose both IsLibr and add the same libr - that would be circular! So, for google-
play-svcs, click the IsLibr, and for the other two (MainActivit and MapTest), do not click, but add the
library.
9. Import the googleplayservices first, and then import other examples.
